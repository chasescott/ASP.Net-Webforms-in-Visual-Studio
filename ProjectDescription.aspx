        For this project, I would like to create an image sharing website specifically aiming to serve the surface pattern design community. A surface pattern designer is a designer who creates repeatable patterns for use on common everyday surfaces such as clothing textiles, furniture fabrics, wallpaper, carpets and so on. From a personal perspective, I have worked as a surface pattern designer for two years now, primarily designing patterns for the interior fabric markets. I also design fabrics used to create the products I sell on my website <a href="https://www.claos.co.uk">CLAOS.co.uk</a> This is therefore a niche community and industry with which I am particularly familiar with.
        <br />
        <br />
        I would like to create a site where surface pattern designers can share examples of their own designs and of images which may have inspired them in the creation of their designs. As design is obviously a visual process, I feel that this is a community that would respond well to a website where they are able to share images of design ideas, concepts and inspiration whilst also show casing their work.
        <br />
        <br />
        In terms of functionality, I would like to create clickable thumbnails that would lead to another page with a larger image together with a description supplied by the artist and a comments facility to enable other designers to comment. I would also like to create a tagging option to help categorise each image – i.e. by colour and/or style (abstract, life etc.).
        <br />
        <br />
        Finally, I would like it to be a requirement that each designer ‘signs up’ to the website before being able to post and/or comment. The sign up process will also require the designer sets up a ‘Profile’ page which can be used to supply further details about the designer (such as any noteworthy projects, awards or qualifications) and a link to their online portfolio and/or website.
